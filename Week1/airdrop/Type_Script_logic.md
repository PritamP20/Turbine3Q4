TS Client Logic

Solana has always leaned on TypeScript for client-side dev, and it makes sense for a few reasons:

Easy for web devs to jump in – Most React/Next.js folks already know TypeScript/JavaScript, so onboarding into Solana dApp dev feels natural. Since a lot of blockchain stuff happens on the client, this lowers the entry barrier big time.

Type safety + smoother DX – With TS you get type checking and IntelliSense, which is super handy when dealing with Solana programs/IDLs. Fewer silly mistakes when building instructions or parsing account data.

Ecosystem stays consistent – Pretty much everything in the Solana world (SDKs, wallets like Phantom/Backpack, frameworks like Anchor/Metaplex) ships TS clients. So devs get a unified, faster workflow end-to-end.

Solana went with TypeScript because it’s dev-friendly, safer, and keeps the whole ecosystem in sync — all of which really helped adoption.
